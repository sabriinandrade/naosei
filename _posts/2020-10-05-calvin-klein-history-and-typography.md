Calvin Klein was a famous designer since the 70s, he was well known for his advertisements instead of any piece of clothing. With only 10,000 dollars Klein decided to open a coat shop in 1968, and it didn’t take long for thousands of people started buying his clothes. The next year, Calvin Klein featured in a Vogue cover and from that point on his career was launched.

He launched women’s lingerie and after a while, he began to sell also menswear. At the end of the 70s decade, Klein decided to launch jeans to his collection of clothes, which made a huge success back in the day and it is still very popular nowadays. Klein knew that advertising would play a huge part in his business, so since from the begging, he would ask celebrities to make photoshoots with his underwear.

Calvin Klein logo is iconic and unique. It shows the brand identity. The typography of the logo changed during the years of its existence. In 1968 the logo was created, and it was used like that until 1975. It consisted of having the simple name “Calkin Klein” written on it, in black, the “C” and “K” as capital letters, in a thinner and stylish font, no serifs. It showed the brand sophistication, elegance and authority. With their typography, they demonstrated confidence and power. Something to be remembered of.

During the period of 1992 and 2017, the letters became thinner and even though the style changed, the font remained the same. Another difference was that the dot above the “i” became a rectangle. A subtle change was also made in the space between the letters, they became a little bit more separated from each other.

The designer of the logo wanted to return the brand spirit to the original way that it was when Calvin Klein was founded. In addition to having incredible typography and recognized in every place, the brand has also its abbreviation “CK”, that it’s now used in everyday life.
