        <h2>A little bit of my story</h2>
        <p> I was born in 1997, in a small village called Vitoria (which means victory) in a small state of Brazil. Life was not luxurus, in fact my parents always fought a lot for me, and for that I'll always be grateful. At age of four, I moved to Portugal. Life in Brazil was complicated, so we decided to move, which I later on in my life discovered that would be somthing that I would be doing quite a while. Our life in Portugal was good, we always had what to eat, we made new friends and my parents found jobs that were good for them. I loved my school, and as the time went by I learned the real meaning of being an immigrant, but I dind't feel as an outsider, Portugal was a plce that I could call home. But at the age of nineteen, I moved to France with my parents. I thought that moving to Portugal had beem the biggest challenge of my life, but I was mistaken, for sure moving to France changed completely my thoughts on that. Moving to a country where you don't speak the language can be a little bit tricky. You feel frustrated and usuless at first, you feel that you will never learn that language, but with time and patience things slowly get better but after two years in France, I hadn't quite yet had the feeling of bellowing there.</p>
        <p> I always had the desire to move to England, so I did. I made the decision to study in the UK. Even with all my insecurities and doubts, I came here alone to follow my dreams. And now I'm studying Media, Journalism and Publishing at Oxford Brookes University, which I never thought I would be possible.</p>

      <h2> My inspirations</h2>
      <p> I can say that I've had a lot of inspirations thoughout my life. Starting with my parents that were real role models for me. But growing up, when I started to sing and envolve myself in the music world, I started to get inspired by singers and what they had to say about their lives and thr world. From Beyoncé and her female empowerment to Demi Lovato and her struggles and addictions. Music made em see the world in a different way, and it was a huge inspiration for me. It made me be able to express my feelings and understand what others would going through, because music has this power.</p>
      <p> My friens have been a huge inspiration for me too. Seeing someone that you love just get thourgh life with all its obstacles, is amazing. Is amazing to see what people can do when they feel inspired to. Another person that has inspired me recently was Trevor Noah. He is a south-african mixed man, born while the apartheid was happening. His life as a child was not easy, and as a mixed child he couldn't feel like he belonged anywhere. Now he is one of the most famous comedians out there and host of the Daily Show. His life's story is amazing and he has come a long way to be where he is now. He didn't let what people said about him or his ethinicity shape who he is now. A true inspiration.</p>

      <h2> Thing that I like to do</h2>
      <p> Growing up I got envolved with music really early, so one of the things that I like to do most is to sing, it takes me to another place and it's a way to express my feelings. I also like to read, watch movies and tv shows, be with my friends and familiy. I like to take pictures, I like to cook a really good meal and have the feeling that it was me that did it. I like to go to the gym, because there I can de-stress a lot and makes me feel good after, I like to listen to music while I'm doing whatever, I'll be listing to music while cooking, taking a shower, studying, at any time. I like to crazy dance. I like to watch sunsets, I think it's the most beautiful thing ever. I like to have plants in my room and make everything aesthetically pleasing. I like to eat chocolate and everything that is sweet actually. I like Disney movies and Matvel movies. I like to cycle and to walk in the nature.</p>

  <h3> My favourite song of the moment</h3>
  <a class= "songlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQOO2xGQ1Pc&ab_channel=JustinBieberVEVO" target="blank"> Justin Bieber & benny blaco - Lonely </a>
  <p> "Lonely" surely is one of the most personal things Justin has ever recorded. The two and half minute long ballad tell his story in a way that he hasn't before. The lyrics express the loneliness Justin has experienced since becoming one of the most talked pop starts on the planet. "What if you had it all, but nobody to call? Maybe you'd know me. Cause I've had everything, but no one's listening and that's so so lonely"</p>
